# StyleCheck

StyleCheck is a tool implemented in [http://www.grammaticalframework.org/](Grammatical Framework). It detects when a rule from a style guide is applied and gives a hint to the translator using StyleCheck when it isnâ€™t.

# Details

StyleCheck was developed as part of my [https://github.com/Deseaus/MastersThesis](Master's Thesis). Follow the link for the full thesis with a more detailed description of how it works. 

The current version implements a limited subset of rules from the Wikipedia Spanish Style Guide (see `Wiki.gf` and `WikiMaster.gf`).
